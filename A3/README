Develop an application that uses Lamport Logical Clocks to totally order
operations on N replicas. Each node hosts a replica. Assume that the replicas represent
bank accounts. Each node can initiate an operation on the bank account. You are to use
Lamport Logical Clocks to ensure that each node uses the same order of operations.


please use the following commands to run the code: 

go run main.go "dcurca 1" :5001 localhost:8500 "operations1.txt"

go run main.go "dcurca 2" :5002 localhost:8500 operations2.txt
