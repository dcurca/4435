Calculator: You are to develop a server that provides the following services: addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two numbers. When the client is started,
it should read a file named input. Each line consists of an operation followed by the
operands. These should be separated by a space. The operations are represented by add,
sub, div and mult. Examples include add 5 1 and div 10 2. You may assume only integer
inputs. The result of an operation returned from the server should be placed in a file
named output. Each result should be on its own line. You should have a file called port
that has one line which is the port number used by the server. This should be read by
the server and the client.

Bank Account Manager: You are to develop a server that provides the following
services: deposit, withdraw, and add interest. When the client is started, it should read
a file named accounts.json. This will have the same format as that in assignment 0. The
client should then read a file named input. The first line is the port number used by the
server. Each line afterwards consists of an operation followed by the amount to be
added or withdrawn or the interest rate to be applied to the current account balance.
The interest rate is between 1 to 10. The operations should be named as deposit,
withdraw and interest. Each of these takes as input the account number. For the deposit
and withdraw operations a second input parameter is the amount, For the interest
operation the second input parameter is the interest rate. The bank server should then
output accountsUpdated.json which should represent the result of the operations
specified in the input file. You should have a file called port that has one line which is
the port number used by the server. This should be read by the server and the client.
